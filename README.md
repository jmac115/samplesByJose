# The following code is one of many I developed to easily integrate data from the SAP MRP system into our local MySQL database to easily analyze and report data. The goal is to make it as simple as possible for the user but powerful enough to accomplish the job with ease.  It utilizes the following technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL

Instructions:

1) Download the .RAR file
2) Copy and paste the SampleApp folder into your www folder
3) Create a database in your MySQL and name it "sap" with Username: root , and Password: abc123 (you can change the username and password, if so, make sure to change it in the php files as well.
4) Then create the two tables noted on the "Create_Tables" text document under the SampleApp folder
5) Go to your browser and type "http://localhost/SampleApp/jFileUpload_app/index.php?folder=Forecast
6) Load in some data from SAP (the MRP system)
